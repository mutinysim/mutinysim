Hey there ✌️ I'm Winters and it seems you have stumbled upon my GitHub profile. I'm a hobbyist game dev and occassional modder who enjoys learning everything about game development. Somewhere between discovering RPG Maker 2000 when I was 13 years old and making my own mods for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, I developed a passion for game development. 
</br></br>
Over the years I have enjoyed being a part of some great communities for game engines like RPG Maker, Game Maker, Unreal Engine and Unity where I have learned just how accessible game development can be. I've also spent time in the modding communities learning and creating mostly personal mods for games like Morrowind and Oblivion and maps for games like Unreal Tournament.

These days I mostly focus on my elephants graveyard of Unity projects or make mods for Assetto Corsa.
